**Hi! This is "bash_facilities"**, a set of scripts to 
give you a better management of your bash config and 
init files. 

Now it is easier to locate and change
your functions, aliases and configs.

Bash is your friend, go ahead and make it your way!

To install, open your terminal (using bash, it will not work on zsh or oh-my-zsh).
